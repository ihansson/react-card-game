# Summary

You are a roving mayor and go from town to town trying to fix it. You build up a deck of card which gives you more options to fix the town.

When you go to a town there will be a set of attributes which are parallels for "health" "defense" "attack" "income". And there will enemies in the form of "misinformation" "scandal" "crime" "health-crisis" which will influence the towns properties.

If a town reaches 0 "health" or "income" the player loses.

The player has some money which it can spend for cards at shops.

## Meta Cycle

At the start the game you will have X generic type cards. You will be presented with 3 rare cards and pick 1.

You will choose to go to the next town.

On completing a town you will be given the choice to take one of 3 cards. The town will also offer to take one of your cards from you. You will also get some number of currency based on the towns final income stat.

Any damage caused to towns will decrease a player's reputation, if reputation reaches 0 they will lose.

Every X number of towns will be a shop.

There is a 'map' which shows X number of total levels and if they are towns or shops.

## In Town Cycle
